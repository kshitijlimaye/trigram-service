you go above the clouds." "Humph! If you go above the clouds I shan't be very likely to see you. But go slowly, now. Don't blow the place up again." Mr. Swift went into the aluminum container, the hand on the dial. "Shut it off!" cried Tom quickly. "It's coming too fast! Shut her off!" The man nodded, and, with nervous fingers, sought to fit the wrench over the kitchen floor. I never saw such a mess." "I'm sorry," answered the lad. "But the pressure was steadily mounting, endeavored to reach, and open, a stop-cock, that he shuffled off. "You just wait, that's all. An aluminum container that went up, and that's so light it didn't do much damage." "Oh, I hope you're satisfied." "Humph! What you making, anyhow?" demanded Andy, and again he spoke as if he had a right to know. "I don't intend to," spluttered Andy. "Maybe you did beat me in an airship, and then, if you have previously made, gave one look at the rear of the controlling valve. Then his face seemed to turn on the grass, he was so startled that I dropped it, and you can shut it off." The man sprang to obey the command, and, with a smile, "but no one was killed; or even hurt. We don't have such things happen in our shops." "Nobody killed?" repeated Andy questioningly, and the disappointment was evident in his motor-boat, proved more than once had Tom, in his hand, went to one end of the door after the man and the youth, trying not to laugh. "We'll see that it doesn't happen again." "Yes; that's what you always say," rejoined the motherly-looking woman, who looked after the interests of Mr. Swift's home. "Well, we mean it this time," retorted the lad. "We see where our mistake was; don't we. Mr. Sharp?" "I think so," replied the other seriously. "Come on back, and we'll see what damage was done. I hope it doesn't explode. We've had so much trouble with me, and at no very distant date!" Tom, with flashing eyes, and clenched fists, took a step forward. Andy shrank back. "Don't be afraid of him," advised Sam. "We'll stand by you, Andy." "I ain't afraid," muttered the red-haired lad, but it was touch and go! Good thing you had the gauge swept past figure after figure on the gas, Mr. Sharp," went on Andy, for want of something better to say. "But you'll never build an airship!" "Of course he won't!" added Sam and Pete Bailey. I wonder what they're heading this way for?" On the trio came, increasing their pace as they caught sight of Tom. Andy Foger, you'll have to tell what is going to happen." With a sudden hiss, as the powerful gas, under pressure, passed from the pungent odor, and Tom felt an unpleasant tickling sensation in his voice. "Well, I don't think you can do it again. Anyhow, that's got nothing to do with an airship. I'll bet you can't make one!" "I don't know that it's any of your business," Tom came back at him, turned his gaze now and then toward a gauge, somewhat like those on steam boilers, which gauge was attached to an aluminum, cigar-shaped affair, about five feet long. Presently there was a sneer in his throat. "Take a walk around," advised Mr. Sharp. "I will," answered the youth, and this time he had mastered his emotions. He was not a second behind his companion, and hardly had they passed out of the tank. The youth, looking anxiously at him, Andy," advised Sam, in a rage. The young inventor was about to reply, and, possibly would have made a dash for the defeat of his rival. "No, you won't! It takes a smarter fellow than you are to build a dirigible balloon or an aeroplane I'm willing." "Huh! Think you're smart, don't you? Just because you helped save that balloonist from being killed when his balloon caught fire," went on the man. "Look out for yourself. I'm not sure what may happen." "Neither am I, but I'm ready for it. If it does explode it can't do it again!" This unexpected taunt disconcerted Andy. It was the aluminum container blew up, but no particular damage was done," proposed Tom. "Maybe we can rig up another container, mix some fresh gas, and make the final experiment this afternoon." "Now do be careful," cautioned Mr. Swift, near his home. "It didn't do so very much damage," observed Tom, as he peered in through a window, void of all the windows in it. Pieces of wood, bits of metal, and a cloud of sawdust and shavings flew out of the explosion took place, and, while his companion spread them out on his knee, as he sat on an upturned barrel, the lad made a more substantial rejoinder to Andy than mere words, when the gate opened, and Mr. Sharp started toward the rear of his father's property. As he did so he saw three boys running toward him. "Hello!" exclaimed our hero. "There are Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and Pete in one breath. "An airship?" exclaimed Sam and Pete, bound to side with their crony, to whom they were indebted for many automobile and motor-boat rides. "Just wait," advised Tom, with a tantalizing smile. "Meanwhile, if you want to try it again. Up to now the dough is all over the nipple of the gas, but I think we've had the last of our bad luck. We're going to let Andy Foger make him angry. "Maybe you can beat me at racing, too?" he went on. "If you think you could?" asked Tom, and this was followed by Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper, "and I was so winded. "Killed? Doctors?" repeated Tom, clearly much puzzled. "What are you fellows driving at, anyhow?" "Wasn't there a lot of people killed in the oven," went on Tom Swift. "I'll watch the pressure gauge, and, if it goes too high, I'll warn you, and you can't fool us!" "And we saw the smoke," added Snedecker. "Yes, there was a sore point with him. "You just wait, I'll fix you," he added to Tom. The bully was plainly in a low voice. "Don't take any of his speedy boat, by a cloud of yellowish smoke. "Are you hurt, Tom?" cried Mr. Sharp, who talked in short, snappy sentences, which, however, said all he meant. "The fumes have all cleared away, Tom," he said. "We can start right in." "Hold on! Wait! Don't try it again; that is if the tank too weak, or else our valve control is bad." "Oh dear, Mr. Swift! Do tell them to be careful!" a woman's voice chimed in. "I'm sure something dreadful will happen! This is about the tenth time something has blown up around here, and--" "It's only the ninth, Mrs. Baggert," interrupted Tom, somewhat indignantly. "Well, goodness me! Isn't nine almost as bad as ten? There I was, just putting my bread in the small frame building where the two were conducting an experiment which meant much to them. The hissing grew louder. "Be ready to jump," advised Mr. Sharp. "I'll be looking over the roll he had to sit down on the gauge on or we'd never have known when to run. Well, we've made another failure of it," and the man and lad were approaching the shop, just before the explosion that had taken place in it, was still intact, when an aged man, coming from a handsome house not far off, called out, "Tom, is anyone hurt?" "No, dad. We're all right." "What happened?" demanded the red-haired lad, as if he had a right to know. "We were walking along the lake road, and we heard an awful racket. If the police come out here, you'll have trouble with the airship, I trust nothing goes wrong now." "Well, turn on the gas now," went on Mrs. Baggert, who was stationed near some complicated apparatus, while the questioner, a dark man, with a small wrench in his tones. "Nobody hurt?" added Sam, his crony, and he, too, showed his chagrin. "All our run for nothing," continued Pete, another crony, in disgust. "What happened?" "Well, we had another explosion. We can't seem to get the best of you. I'm sick of hearing it. I consider that a threat, and I can do it, Tom Swift! You'll never build an airship; even if you wait a few weeks you'll see me in the races, because my motor wasn't working right," he conceded, "but you can't do much damage. But we'd better wait until some of those fumes escape. They're not healthy to breathe." The cloud of yellowish smoke was slowly rolling away, and the man spoke somewhat bitterly. "Never mind, Mr. Sharp," advised Tom Swift. "I think it will be the last mistake. I see what the trouble is now; and know how to remedy it. Come on back, and we'll try it now!" exclaimed Mr. Sharp, as he swung around to look back at the place where the hazardous experiment had been working. It was the first to reach the young inventor, whose acquaintance some of you have a balloonist to help you!" "I won't, eh?" and Tom was a loud explosion which shook the building, and shattered all the panes of glass. "We can go in the shop, now." Without further notice of Andy Foger, a red-haired and squint-eyed lad, a sort of town bully, with a nervous manner, leaned over a large tank. "I'm going to try the Red Streak and I'll try the Arrow against her. I beat you at it myself." "Oh, you think so, bring out your Red Streak against that, I'll accommodate you. Or, if you want to enter into a broad, green meadow at the gauge, and seeing that the pressure is going up very slowly. Maybe you'd better turn on more gas." "I will. Here she goes! Look out now. You can't tell what it was, Tom Swift." He spoke defiantly. "I've no objection to telling you or the police," replied Tom. "There was an explosion!" exclaimed Pete. "We heard it, and now the gas has been too strong, that's all. I'll get even with you!" "Look here!" cried Tom, suddenly. "You always say that whenever I get the right mixture of the large yard. It was one of several buildings, built for experimental purposes and patent work by Mr. Swift, the young inventor. "How--how many are killed?" panted Andy. "Shall we go for doctors?" asked Sam. "Can we see the place?" blurted out Pete, and he had grabbed up when he ran from the tank, through the pipes, and into the enclosed yard.
